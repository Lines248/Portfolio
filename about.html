                     <p>
                        Hi, I’m Lines Sultzer, a junior full-stack developer who works in Java, Python, SQL, and modern JavaScript, with a natural pull toward front-end engineering. I came into software through design and fabrication, where I learned to build systems, troubleshoot precisely, and pay attention to how people move through an experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started coding during recovery from a studio injury and later completed a full-stack Java bootcamp, building projects with Java, PostgreSQL, Vue, and core web technologies. Since graduating, I’ve continued developing skills in React, accessibility, and front-end architecture while grounding my understanding of backend fundamentals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         I like building clean, semantic, usable interfaces. I’m looking for a team where I can contribute, grow, and write software that's easy to use and meaningful to interact with.
                    </p>
