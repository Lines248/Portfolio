            <p>
                I’m Lines Sultzer, a junior full-stack developer with a strong focus on the front end. I came into software from design, fabrication, and creative tech, where I learned how to break complex systems into clear, functional steps. That mindset carried naturally into engineering.    
            </p>
            <p>
                 I started coding with Python, then completed a full-stack Java bootcamp where I worked with Java, PostgreSQL, Vue, HTML, CSS, and core web fundamentals. Since then, I’ve leaned deeper into modern JavaScript and React while continuing to build my backend skills in Java and Python. Working across the stack taught me how data moves, how interfaces behave, and how to build features that are reliable and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I care about clean, semantic code, accessible patterns, and building interfaces that make sense. My design background helps me think like a user; my engineering training helps me structure things correctly. Freelancing taught me how to communicate clearly, deliver consistently, and work from requirements through deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a junior developer, but I bring strong fundamentals, steady follow-through, and genuine curiosity. I’m looking for a team where I can contribute, grow, and build software that feels clear and usable for everyone.
