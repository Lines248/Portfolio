    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I’m Lines, a developer who came into software through design, fabrication, and creative technology. I used to build physical systems and interactive environments, which taught me to think about structure, clarity, and the way people move through an experience. Those habits carried naturally into engineering once I began writing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a studio injury, I shifted my work toward software and retrained from the ground up. I completed a full-stack Java bootcamp, and continued studying Python, SQL, and modern JavaScript on my own. I learned how to work across the stack, from building user interfaces to understanding how data should flow behind them. Accessibility also became a core part of how I approach engineering, because it leads to cleaner decisions and more reliable interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
       What I enjoy most about development is working through problems in a way that feels structured and intentional. I like building interfaces that make sense, writing code that is readable, and shaping systems that stay maintainable over time. My background in design helps me think about the user experience as I build, and my work in fabrication taught me patience, communication, and how to collaborate toward a shared outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am a junior full-stack developer, but I naturally lean toward the front end. I like working on the parts people interact with, while still understanding the logic and data that support them. I bring strong fundamentals, consistent follow-through, and a genuine commitment to learning. Most of all, I care about building things that are clear, accessible, and easy to use.
