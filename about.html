            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
            I'm Lines, a front-end developer and creative technologist focused on accessible, clear, and thoughtful interaction. My background is in design, installation work, and creative tech, where I built physical systems, objects, and environments. That experience shaped how I think about structure, material, and the way people move through an experience.
    </p>            </p>

              <p>
        After a studio accident and the onset of CRPS, I shifted fully into software. Coding became another material to work with, and accessibility became the foundation of my approach. Today I build modern interfaces with semantic HTML, clean architecture, and inclusive interaction patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        My work centers on clarity and usability. I focus on accessible front-end development, modern JavaScript, and design-led engineering, bringing precision, care, and a sense of craft into the things I build.
