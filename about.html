                <p>
                    I’m Lines Sultzer, a full-stack junior developer with a strong foundation in Java, Python, SQL, and modern JavaScript, with a natural pull toward front-end engineering. I came into software through design, fabrication, and creative technology, where I spent years building physical systems and installations. That work taught me how to think structurally, solve problems with intention, and keep both precision and user experience in mind.
                </p>

                    I began learning to code during recovery from a studio injury, starting with Python before completing a full-stack Java bootcamp. There, I built with Java, PostgreSQL, Vue, HTML, CSS, and core web fundamentals and learned the value of pair-programming and agile workflows. Since graduating I've continued expanding into React, accessibility, and front-end architecture on my own. Working across the stack helped me understand how data moves, how interfaces should behave, and how to write clean code that supports both. 
                </p>
                 
            <p>
                I care about clean, semantic code, accessible patterns, and building interfaces that make sense. My design background helps me think like a user; my engineering training helps me structure things correctly. Freelancing taught me how to communicate clearly, deliver consistently, and work from requirements through deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a junior developer, but I bring strong fundamentals, steady follow-through, and genuine curiosity. I’m looking for a team where I can contribute, grow, and build software that feels clear and usable for everyone.
